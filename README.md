Recommendation Systems for eCommerce 

Definition 
Recommender systems are programs that make suggestions to the user based on different aspects. These algorithms estimate the most likely product that customers will buy and that they will be interested in.

Facts -I
Netflix disclosed that "75% of what people watch is from some sort of recommendation" [1].
YouTube reports that 60% of the clicks on the home screen are on the recommendations [2].
According to a statement of Amazon’s CEO in 2006, about 35 % of their sales originate from cross-sales (aka recommendation)[3].
These examples show how personalization and suggestion may have a tremendous impact.

Business Value of Recommenders 
The business value added by a recommender system depends mainly on the business model. In domains like eCommerce, the effect of a recommender is direct on sales and profits/revenues. 

Facts -II
Lee and Hosanagerinvestigated the impact of recommenders on sales and observed a 35% lift in sales upon utilizing the personalization engines [4].
Another evaluation work was presented in [5], and results showed 28% more profit when using a new recommendation than a simple one, besides, the revenue dropped by 17% when no recommenders were used. 


In the tagged Notebook, I outline the process of building a recommendation model using Amazon SageMaker.
